Math::FixedPrecision - Decimal Math without Floating Point Errors

This module tries to deal with the common situation of not wanting to use 
floating point calculations for decimal numbers.  One example is currency 
values, which should never contain partial units (e.g. cents in USD).  
Another example is in scientific measurements, where the accuracy should 
always be limited to the least accurate data point.  A third example is 
Floating Point notation errors (e.g., What is 100/9?).

This module is not a replacement for Math::BigFloat, rather it serves a similar
but slightly different purpose.  By strictly limiting precision automatically,
this module operates slightly more natually than Math::BigFloat, when dealing
with floating point numbers of limited accuracy.  Math::FixedPrecision does not
handle exponential notation, whereas Math::BigFloat can unintentially inflate
the accuracy of a calculation.

To install, do the usual:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
